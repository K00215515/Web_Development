        <h2>Making the Website</h2>
        <p>Below is the prototype and a sketch of the website before developing the website in brackets:</p>
        <h3>Sketch</h3>
        <img src="img/sketch.png" alt="Sketch"/>
        <h3>Moodboard</h3>
        <img src="img/Moodboard.png" alt="Moodboard"/>
        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <img src="img/Prototype.png" alt="Prototype"/>
            
        <p>These images were used as guide to make this website to contain the VTEC video.</p>
            
        <h3>Design elements used</h3>
        <p>The two background colours are separated by using a div in the html file. The div would be called by a name such as "page" which can be used to create a background colour that is different from the body background.</p> 
            
        <p>The navigation bar and the style of the header was taken from a previous assignment as inspiration. The navigation bar has a display of inline which is just vertical. The style of the header is only using the font-style element with underline and overline. The website is adaptable if the screen is small such as 300px like a smartphone. There are 3 methods for this website to be adaptable screen width which are 360px, 780px and 1010px.The assignment link is below:</p>
